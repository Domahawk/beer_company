VALUES ('Buzz', 'A light, crisp and bitter IPA brewed with English and American hops. A small batch brewed only once.', 'A Real Bitter Experience.', 4.5),
       ('Trashy Blonde', 'A titillating, neurotic, peroxide punk of a Pale Ale. Combining attitude, style, substance, and a little bit of low self esteem for good measure; what would your mother say? The seductive lure of the sassy passion fruit hop proves too much to resist. All that is even before we get onto the fact that there are no additives, preservatives, pasteurization or strings attached. All wrapped up with the customary BrewDog bite and imaginative twist.', 'You Know You Shouldn''t', 4.1),
       ('Berliner Weisse With Yuzu - B-Sides', 'Japanese citrus fruit intensifies the sour nature of this German classic.', 'Japanese Citrus Berliner Weisse.', 4.2),
       ('Pilsen Lager', 'Our Unleash the Yeast series was an epic experiment into the differences in aroma and flavour provided by switching up your yeast. We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. Pilsner yeast ferments with no fruity esters or spicy phenols, although it can add a hint of butterscotch.', 'Unleash the Yeast Series.', 6.3),
       ('Avery Brown Dredge', 'An Imperial Pilsner in collaboration with beer writers. Tradition. Homage. Revolution. We wanted to showcase the awesome backbone of the Czech brewing tradition, the noble Saaz hop, and also tip our hats to the modern beers that rock our world, and the people who make them.', 'Bloggers'' Imperial Pilsner.', 7.2),
       ('Electric India', 'Re-brewed as a spring seasonal, this beer – which appeared originally as an Equity Punk shareholder creation – retains its trademark spicy, fruity edge. A perfect blend of Belgian Saison and US IPA, crushed peppercorns and heather honey are also added to produce a genuinely unique beer.', 'Vibrant Hoppy Saison.', 5.2),
       ('AB:12', 'An Imperial Black Belgian Ale aged in old Invergordon Scotch whisky barrels with mountains of raspberries, tayberries and blackberries in each cask. Decadent but light and dry, this beer would make a fantastic base for ageing on pretty much any dark fruit - we used raspberries, tayberries and blackberries beause they were local.', 'Imperial Black Belgian Ale.', 11.2),
       ('Fake Lager', 'Fake is the new black. Fake is where it is at. Fake Art, fake brands, fake breasts, and fake lager. We want to play our part in the ugly fallout from the Lager Dream. Say hello to Fake Lager – a zesty, floral 21st century faux masterpiece with added BrewDog bitterness.', 'Bohemian Pilsner.', 4.7),
       ('AB:07', 'Whisky cask-aged imperial scotch ale. Beer perfect for when the rain is coming sideways. Liquorice, plum and raisin temper the warming alcohol, producing a beer capable of holding back the Scottish chill.', 'Whisky Cask-Aged Scotch Ale.', 12.5),
       ('Bramling X', 'Good old Bramling Cross is elegant, refined, assured, (boring) and understated. Understated that is unless you hop the living daylights out of a beer with it. This is Bramling Cross re-invented and re-imagined, and shows just what can be done with English hops if you use enough of them. Poor Bramling Cross normally gets lost in a woeful stream of conformist brown ales made by sleepy cask ale brewers. But not anymore. This beer shows that British hops do have some soul, and is a fruity riot of blackberries, pears, and plums. Reminds me of the bramble, apple and ginger jam my grandmother used to make.', 'Single Hop IPA Series - 2011.', 7.5),
       ('Misspent Youth', 'The brainchild of our small batch brewer, George Woods. A dangerously drinkable milk sugar- infused Scotch Ale.', 'Milk & Honey Scotch Ale.', 7.3),
       ('Arcade Nation', 'Running the knife-edge between an India Pale Ale and a Stout, this particular style is one we truly love. Black IPAs are a great showcase for the skill of our brew team, balancing so many complex and twisting flavours in the same moment. The citrus, mango and pine from the hops – three of our all-time favourites – play off against the roasty dryness from the malt bill at each and every turn.', 'Seasonal Black IPA.', 5.3),
       ('Movember', 'A deliciously robust, black malted beer with a decadent dark, dry cocoa flavour that provides an enticing backdrop to the Cascade hops.', 'Moustache-Worthy Beer.', 4.5),
       ('Alpha Dog', 'A fusion of caramel malt flavours and punchy New Zealand hops. A session beer you can get your teeth into.', 'Existential Red Ale.', 4.5),
       ('Mixtape 8', 'This recipe is for the Belgian Tripel base. A blend of two huge oak aged beers – half a hopped up Belgian Tripel, and half a Triple India Pale Ale. Both aged in single grain whisky barrels for two years and blended, each beer brings its own character to the mix. The Belgian Tripel comes loaded with complex spicy, fruity esters, and punchy citrus hop character.', 'An Epic Fusion Of Old Belgian, American New Wave, And Scotch Whisky.', 14.5),
       ('Libertine Porter', 'An avalanche of cross-continental hop varieties give this porter a complex spicy, resinous and citrusy aroma, with a huge malt bill providing a complex roasty counterpoint. Digging deeper into the flavour draws out cinder toffee, bitter chocolate and hints of woodsmoke.', 'Dry-Hopped Aggressive Porter.', 6.1),
       ('AB:06', 'Our sixth Abstrakt, this imperial black IPA combined dark malts with a monumental triple dry-hop, using an all-star team of some of our favourite American hops. Roasty and resinous.', 'Imperial Black IPA.', 11.2),
       ('Russian Doll – India Pale Ale', 'The levels of hops vary throughout the range. We love hops, so all four beers are big, bitter badasses, but by tweaking the amount of each hop used later in the boil and during dry- hopping, we can balance the malty backbone with some unexpected flavours. Simcoe is used in the whirlpool for all four beers, and yet still lends different characters to each', 'Nesting Hop Bomb.', 6.0),
       ('Hello My Name Is Mette-Marit', 'We sent this beer to Norway where it was known as ''Hello, my name is Censored’. You can make up your own mind as to why. This brew was a red berry explosion, with a reisnous bitter edge layered with dry berry tartness.', 'Lingonberry Double IPA.', 8.2),
       ('Rabiator', 'Imperial Wheat beer / Weizenbock brewed by a homesick German in leather trousers. Think banana bread, bubble gum and David Hasselhoff.', 'Imperial Wheat Beer', 10.3),
       ('Vice Bier', 'Our take on the classic German Kristallweizen. A clear German wheat beer, layers of bubblegum and vanilla perfectly balanced with the American and New Zealand hops.', 'Hoppy Wheat Bier.', 4.3),
       ('Devine Rebel (w/ Mikkeller)', 'Two of Europe''s most experimental, boundary-pushing brewers, BrewDog and Mikkeller, combined forces to produce a rebellious beer that combined their respective talents and brewing skills. The 12.5% Barley Wine fermented well, and the champagne yeast drew it ever closer to 12.5%. The beer was brewed with a single hop variety and was going to be partially aged in oak casks.', 'Oak-aged Barley Wine.', 12.5),
       ('Storm', 'Dark and powerful Islay magic infuses this tropical sensation of an IPA. Using the original Punk IPA as a base, we boosted the ABV to 8% giving it some extra backbone to stand up to the peated smoke imported directly from Islay.', 'Islay Whisky Aged IPA.', 8.0),
       ('The End Of History', 'The End of History: The name derives from the famous work of philosopher Francis Fukuyama, this is to beer what democracy is to history. Complexity defined. Floral, grapefruit, caramel and cloves are intensified by boozy heat.', 'The World''s Strongest Beer.', 55.0),
       ('Bad Pixie', '2008 Prototype beer, a 4.7% wheat ale with crushed juniper berries and citrus peel.', 'Spiced Wheat Beer.', 4.7),
       ('Skull Candy', 'The first beer that we brewed on our newly commissioned 5000 litre brewhouse in Fraserburgh 2009. A beer with the malt and body of an English bitter, but the heart and soul of vibrant citrus US hops.', 'Pacific Hopped Amber Bitter.', 3.5),
       ('Dog B', 'Our anniversary stout was based on AB:04, one of our most sought after beers ever. This beer is slightly different each year, with subtle variations coming into play purely down to environmental and fermentation factors. What doesn''t change is the rich dark chocolate, bitter coffee and chilli warmth of this monumental Stout.', 'Cacao, Coffee Chili Anniversary Stout.', 15.0),
       ('HBC 369', 'HBC 369 brings rich fruity flavours with the tiniest layer of candy coating on top. HBC 369 (the hop) can bring notes of blueberries, pear, and possibly even sweet potato. HBC 369 (the beer) was balanced, with just one hop providing a complex aroma, and a dry bitterness.', 'Single Hop India Pale Ale – 2012.', 6.7),
       ('10 Heads High', '10 Heads High is loosely based on our awesome 2011 Prototype beer Hops Kill Nazis. This is an uncompromising 7.8% Imperial Red Ale loaded high with American Hops. Think of this as an Imperial India Red Ale, or a super-charged version of 5am Saint. Either way this is a seriously good beer!', 'Imperial Red Ale.', 7.8),
       ('Dana - IPA Is Dead', 'Hailing from Slovenia, Dana was originally cross bred from the German Hallertau Magnum and native Slovenian varieties. Like any good faux noble hop should, it infuses a rustic, musty spiciness into a toasty beast of a malt base.', 'Single Hop India Pale Ale.', 6.7),
       ('Nanny State', 'Brewing a full flavoured craft beer at 0.5% is no easy task. Packed with loads of Centennial, Amarillo, Columbus, Cascade and Simcoe hops, dry hopped to the brink and back and sitting at 55 IBUs, Nanny State is a force to be reckoned with. With a backbone of 8 different specialty malts, Nanny State will tantalise your taste buds and leave you yearning for more.', 'Alcohol Free Hoppy Ale.', 0.5),
       ('AB:05', 'Belgian Imperial Stout aged on toasted coconut and cacao. The Belgian yeast strain introduces a whole new dimension to the Imperial Stout style resulting in a beer that resembles a marshmallow toasted on a smouldering barbeque then smothered in dark chocolate. Massively seductive and encapsulating this blacker than midnight beer pours with coffee brown head so thick you could almost stand on it, and with an epic lacing on your glass.', 'Belgian Imperial Stout.', 12.5),
       ('Sorachi Ace', 'A hop that tastes of bubble gum? Seriously? No, we did not believe it either. But it does! This is one unique, son of a bitch of a hop. Lemony, deep, musty with a smoothness that belies its power. This hop is lemony like a lemon who was angry earlier but is now tired because of all the rage. This hop of Japanese origin is best enjoyed trying to make sushi from your gold fish, or trying to persuade your girlfriend (or boyfriend maybe) to dress up as a Geisha for Valentine’s Day.', 'Single Hop IPA Series - 2011.', 7.5),
       ('Bourbon Baby', 'Santa Paws Scotch ale aged in bourbon barrels - light, dry and toasty, with vanilla, hints of chocolate and ginger biscuit, and a faint spicy hoppiness.', 'Barrel-Aged Scotch Ale.', 5.8),
       ('Berliner Weisse With Raspberries And Rhubarb - B-Sides', 'Tart, dry and acidic with a punch of summer berry as rhubarb crumble.', 'Fruity Berliner Weisse.', 3.6),
       ('Shipwrecker Circus (w/ Oskar Blues)', 'In collaboration with the awesome Oskar Blues from Colorado, we created this big, twisted 10.5% American style barley wine. Big boozy aromas and a sweet viscosity, packed in with some heavy-hitting C-hops, for an intense bitterness to balance this full-bodied malt monster.', 'American Barley Wine - Oskar Blues Collab.', 10.5),
       ('Zephyr', 'A 9.2% Double IPA aged for 21 months in a 1965 Invergordon cask with 30 kg of fresh highland strawberries. This beer is a riot of whisky, caramel and strawberry, all tempered by a toe curling bitterness enducing rapture in all who taste it. Who needs champagne?', 'There’s A Storm Brewing.', 12.5),
       ('Belgian Trappist', 'Our Unleash the Yeast series was an epic experiment into the differences in aroma and flavour provided by switching up your yeast. We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. Abbey style yeasts add distinctive spicy and fruity notes, and dry out the finished beer.', 'Unleash the Yeast Series.', 6.3),
       ('Kohatu - IPA Is Dead', 'As you’d expect from a New Zealand hop variety, Kohatu contributes bags of tropical fruit, but with loads of lime notes, & pineapple hits. Seriously fruity, with sweet, juicy melon and stonefruit notes.', 'Single Hop India Pale Ale.', 7.2),
       ('Hello My Name is Vladimir', 'A Limonnik-infused, triple dry- hopped double IPA. Dry berry tartness and intense citrus hop character meld with a dry bready malt base, boosted by a hint of alcohol warmth. This beer was brewed as a protest against the anti-LGBT legislation in Russia surrounding the Sochi Olympics.', 'Limonnik Infused Imperial IPA (Not for Gays).', 8.2),
       ('AB:17', 'A triple whammy of coffee from HasBean gives our 17th Abstrakt concept beer an intense and roasty, dark mocha character. We brewed with espresso in the mash, cafetiere in the boil, and whole roast beans in the whirlpool and the fermenter.', 'Three Coffee Rye Imperial Porter.', 10.7),
       ('Hardcore IPA', 'Pounding a triple payload of the biggest North American hops humanity has devised, braced by a backbone of caramel malt, this beer is deep, astringent and resinous, pushing to the extremes of lupulin thresholds. There’s nothing inscrutable going on; no mystery in the backstory. It doesn’t seek to be understood. A beer incapable of empathy; only hop overload.', 'Explicit Imperial Ale. Citrusy. Resinous. Intense.', 9.2),
       ('American Wheat', 'A luscious blend of peach, blood orange and banana to make a suitably refreshing beverage that happily straddles the Atlantic.', 'Hoppy American Wheat.', 4.5),
       ('Dog Wired (w/8 Wired)', 'Brewed in collaboration with Soren from New Zealand’s stellar 8-Wired brewery, this is an Imperial Pilsner featuring two of our favourite New Zealand hops: Nelson Sauvin and Motueka. Sitting at a dangerously drinkable 7.1% ABV there’s a touch of Munich malt which gives this beer that little extra caramel biscuit bite to compliment the lip smackingly tropical hops. Expect an all out NZ hoppy riot.', 'New Zealand Imperial Pilsner.', 7.1),
       ('The Physics', 'A hoppy Amber Ale that won World''s Best Amber Beer in the World Beer Awards 2007. Malt and hops are in perfect harmony in this incredibly balanced beer. Biscuity, bitter and packing a surprisingly hoppy punch, this beer ultimately morphed into 5AM Saint.', 'Laid Back Amber Beer.', 5.0),
       ('Anarchist Alchemist', 'About as far as you can push an IPA; Anarchist Alchemist packs in three times the malt and three of our favourite hops.

       ('AB:15', 'A salted caramel popcorn Imperial Ale. Bourbon and Rum barrel aged, this 12.8% ale has complex and twisting flavours.

The salted caramel popcorn lends subtle hints of a smoky brininess.', 'Salted Caramel Popcorn Strong Ale.', 12.8),
       ('Goldings - IPA Is Dead', 'This is East Kent Goldings re- invented and re-imagined and shows just what can be done with English hops if you use enough of them. In this amped up Goldings reincarnation expect to be slammed with floral lavender, a fruity riot of blackberries and spiced pears, bubblegum, plums and the illusion of thyme.', 'Single Hop India Pale Ale.', 6.7),
       ('AB:14', 'Think banoffee pie; loads of creamy sweet banana, and sticky warm toffee. This beer is super complex, and one for the sweet-toothed!', 'Oak-Aged Imperial Weizenbock.', 10.0),
       ('Lost Dog (w/Lost Abbey)', 'Our first beer aged in rum casks, Lost Dog saw us brew a collaboration imperial porter with our friends at Lost Abbey.

       ('TM10', 'Brewed for the Tate Modern’s 10th Anniversary. A saison style beer brewed with ginger and orange peel. Very limited batch of 4000 cork and caged bottles with a silk screened label designed by Johanna Basford. Only available at the Tate Modern.', 'Liquid Art.', 5.5),
       ('Paradox Islay', 'In 2006 James and Martin hijacked a beer dinner run by Michael Jackson, the acclaimed beer and whisky writer, and convinced him to taste one of their home brews. This was a defining moment in BrewDog prehistory, and that beer was the first incarnation of the ubiquitous Paradox. Aged in a variety of casks over the years, Paradox is dark, decadent and encapsulating. Can be enjoyed fresh; phenomenal when aged.', 'Ubiquitous Imperial Stout.', 10.0),
       ('Baby Dogma', 'A baby Scotch ale with dry and toasty malt flavours and hints of smoke. Toffee, biscuit and fudge abound with a spicy bitterness from the pan-global hops.', 'Session Scotch Ale.', 4.5),
       ('Albino Squid Assasin', 'This tentacled terminator packs a punch - ten punches to be precise. Each hop addition adds to the intense layers of depth in this red rye IPA. Toasty caramel & cinder toffee from crystal malts, cacao richness from intensely roasted malt and the spiciness of rye. Zesty pithiness from Citra and the robust resin of Chinook. This small batch exclusive brew is up-front intensity matched with twisted complexity. The can features awesome custom art from Joe Wilson.', 'Red Rye IPA', 7.4),
       ('Amarillo - IPA Is Dead', 'Citrus fruit. Lots of citrus fruit. Think blood orange, orange zest and grapefruit, tangerine and lemon; the fruit is balanced by floral notes in the most classic of new wave IPA hops. Amarillo adds a zesty, pithy character that sits beautifully alongside hints of toffee and honeycomb.', 'Single Hop India Pale Ale.', 7.2),
       ('Black Eyed King Imp', 'An early Cocoa Psycho recipe that we loved, but didn''t fit what we were looking for. We locked this chocolate coffee stout away in barrels for two years, imparting toasted marshmallow, spicy vanilla, molasses and boozy warmth.', 'Barrel-Aged Prototype Cocoa Psycho.', 9.5),
       ('Prototype 27', 'Hardcore IPA with raspberries aged in Caol Ila casks. Full-bodied and compelling, the robust malt base provides an initial layer of honey, cinnamon and biscuity malt sweetness. Soon the Scottish berries are in on the act, a dominating tug of war between sweet and tart with an overbearing zest. As the beer slips back across your tongue the hops demand and definitely get your attention. At 100 IBUs the bitterness smashes into the back of your throat as the resinous, spiced orange peel flavours add depth to the berry fruitiness.', 'Vibrant Smoky Pink IPA.', 9.2),
       ('Coffee Imperial Stout', 'This beer was released as both as "Danish Beerhouse Coffee Imperial Stout" and "BrewDog Coffee Imperial Stout". Deep, dark, roasted flavours make this a perfect Sunday brunch beer.', 'Beats a Cup of Joe.', 9.0),
       ('Mandarina Bavaria - IPA Is Dead', 'From the central European plains of Germany, comes something very different. A blast of tangerine and orange, Mandarina Bavaria brings a highly distinctive backbone of flavour. This is down to its parent – Cascade – and a frankly enormous 70% myrcene oil content. If equate Germany solely with earthy, spicy Noble hops, Mandarina Bavaria will make you think again.', 'Single Hop India Pale Ale.', 7.2),
       ('Dogma', 'Brewed with over ten different types of malt, and blended together with Scottish heather honey, it is a pantheon to the gods of intricacy and nuance; a beer that celebratesa confluence of ideas. Complex, indulgent and encapsulating, Dogma gives more than a cursory nod to history, to make you ponder the very nature of beer itself.', 'Revamped Wee Heavy. Luscious. Malty. Fruity.', 7.5),
       ('Magic Stone Dog (w/Magic Rock & Stone Brewing Co.)', 'A session IPA brewed with a diverse grain bill, hopped with Simcoe and Amarillo and fermented with saison yeast, for an incredible level of depth in a low ABV beer. Spicy, fruity, complex, refreshing and dry.', 'Session Farmhouse IPA - Stone / Magic Rock Collab.', 4.6),
       ('AB:08', 'Flavours and aromas you''d expect from a Stout, but brewed without dark malts. The full mouthfeel comes courtesy of wheat and oats, while smoked malt and the twist additions add the complex flavours normally provided by highly kilned malts.', 'Deconstructed Blonde Imperial Stout.', 10.4),
       ('Sunk Punk', 'It''s rumoured just a drop can calm the fiercest of storms. A balance of sweet, salt and savoury, citrus, spruce and caramel. Fermented at the bottom of the North Sea, which just so happens to be the perfect temperature for lagers to ferment.', 'Ocean Fermented Lager.', 7.1),
       ('Sub Hop', 'Brewed for the opening of our first bar in Italy, BrewDog Firenze. A mega-hoppy Imperial Pilsner, with toasty malt complexity and tropical New World hops.', 'Hopped-Up Imperial Pilsner.', 8.0),
       ('Bracken''s Porter', 'The beer was named Bracken’s Porter as a tribute to our favourite four pawed friend who sadly passed in 2013.

       ('Hunter Foundation Pale Ale', 'This straight-up US style pale ale uses some of our favourite hops against a toasty malt base. We brewed this with Sir Tom Hunter at our Fraserburgh brewery - to add a charitable element to your own version, feel free to share this citrusy pale ale with your friends.

       ('Hype', 'A perfect pale ale showcase for the tropical profile of New Zealand hops and the intense citrus of US hops.', 'New Zealand Pale Ale.', 4.1),
       ('AB:16', 'On the nose, clove and nutmeg, cafe au lait, subtle dark fruit notes, and hints of candied lemon peel. On the palate, smooth & fruity espresso, milk chocolate, and warm brandy-soaked currants are in the middle of a high-class dance-off against the spicy and peppery Belgian character. The overall impression evokes malt loaf or ginger cake.', 'Coffee-Infused Belgian Quad.', 10.6),
       ('Sunmaid Stout', 'Brewed by Chris Sartori from Stone Brewing Company in 2010. A dark chocolate stout with dried dark fruit finish. Simcoe provides bitterness with subtle fruity supporting notes, contrasting the chocolate and coffee-laden malt profile. The finish is warming with vanilla and rich dark fruit depth.', 'Rum & Raisin Imperial Stout.', 10.2),
       ('Pale - Russian Doll', 'The levels of hops vary throughout the range. We love hops, so all four beers are big, bitter badasses, but by tweaking the amount of each hop used later in the boil and during dry- hopping, we can balance the malty backbone with some unexpected flavours. Simcoe is used in the whirlpool for all four beers, and yet still lends different characters to each.', 'Nesting Hop Bomb.', 4.0),
       ('Whisky Sour - B-Sides', 'Deconstructed whisky sour, reconstructed as a beer.', 'Pilot Brew - Deconstructed Whisky Sour.', 7.0),
       ('Black Eyed King Imp - Vietnamese Coffee Edition', 'This is the Vietnamese Coffee Edition.

       ('Eurotrash', 'Trashy Blonde with a Belgian Twist. Clove oil, red apples and a drier mouthfeel set this beer apart from its older sister.', 'Belgian Blonde.', 4.1),

       ('#Mashtag 2013', 'A rich, nutty Brown Ale with a deep, rich malt profile, hopped with a range of citrusy and spicy US varieties. Mellow yet endlessly complex, with enough chocolate and fruit character to balance the bitterness, and a soft oaky roundness.', 'Democratic American Brown Ale.', 7.5),
       ('Hobo Pop', 'Brewed with mountains of Wheat, Rye, Cara and Crystal malts, fermented with an American ale yeast and bittered with Amarillo & Centennial, this 4.2% beer is what happens if something classy like a European wheat beer goes to live in Vegas.

       ('AB:18', 'AB:18 began life as an Imperial Brown Ale before we bombarded it with Scottish tayberries and Purple raspberries and locked it away in rum barrels for two years, infusing rich dark fruit flavours and oaky warmth into the mix.', 'Imperial Brown Ale Aged In Rum Casks.', 11.8),
       ('Hops Kill Nazis', '5AM Saint''s big brother. Dry- hopping with Chinook gave Hops Kill Nazis a full-on, instantly recognisable US hop character - huge resinous aromas (think giant redwood) with a bitter grapefruit edge.

       ('AB:04', 'Imperial Stout brewed with coffee, cocoa, Naga chillies (the hottest in the world), and champagne yeast. Possibly our most acclaimed Abstrakt yet.', 'Imperial Stout With Coffee, Loads Of Cocoa And Chilli.', 15.0);
